# Testing Discipline (Always)

For **every code change** (including refactors and bug fixes):

- **Update existing tests** affected by the change.
- **Add new tests** to cover new behavior, bug fixes, and edge cases (including “empty/blank/null input” cases).
- **Run the entire test suite** before considering the work done (project default, e.g. `mvn test`).
- **Fix any failing tests** until the full suite is green. Don’t leave regressions for later.

Do not “skip tests” (e.g. `-DskipTests`, `--no-tests`) to get a passing build.
